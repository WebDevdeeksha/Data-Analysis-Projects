Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measure of the size and health of an economy. 
It is used to compare the economic output of different countries.
Using the Plotly module, I visualized the GDP growth of individual countries in separate graphs, as well as all countries in one graph for comparison.
I also compared the GDP growth of two or more countries for visualization of the best GDP growth.
