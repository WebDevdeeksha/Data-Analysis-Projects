Black Friday is a shopping holiday known for its deep discounts and special deals on a wide range
of products, including electronics, home goods, clothing, and more. 
My main goal is to conduct various types of analysis and provide valuable market insights for the company. 
I carefully analyzed each column of the dataset, handling null values and also created graphs, charts, and plots
to visualize sales performance using the Pandas and Seaborn libraries.
