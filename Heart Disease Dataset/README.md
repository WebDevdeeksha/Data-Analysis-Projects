I am analyzing the heart disease dataset, which contains records of patients, some suffering from heart diseases and others not. 
I'm examining the ratio of patients with heart diseases across different factors such as age, cholesterol, gender, and more.
I will use a histogram to analyze which age group has the highest likelihood of heart problems.
Additionally, I will use a violin plot to compare the likelihood of heart diseases between males and females.
I will visualize the correlation between different variables in the dataset using a heat map.
Finally, I will use a joint plot to visualize the relationship between two variables and the individual distributions of the variables.
